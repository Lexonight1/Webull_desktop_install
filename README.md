This is a simple bash script to install Webull desktop on fedora, only tested on fedora 42.
Seems the only provide a deb for ubuntu, but with podman and toolbox we can make it happen
Read the script and try it out, works for me
do not forget to chmod -x this file i.e chmod -x Webull_install.sh
then run in terminal i.e bash Webull_install.sh
